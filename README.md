## üêû Debugging & Problem Solving

During development, I encountered and resolved several issues using Chrome DevTools, Django logs, and Heroku CLI. Key fixes included:

- **AJAX Ingredient Search**: Corrected a CSRF token issue and adjusted `data-url` in the dynamic form.
- **Static Files on Heroku**: Solved by setting up Whitenoise, ensuring `collectstatic` ran, and configuring `STATIC_ROOT`.
- **Formset Save Errors**: Fixed by using `commit=False` and linking child form data to the parent `Recipe` object.
- **404 on Recipe Detail**: Traced to a missing `pk` in the URL ‚Äî resolved with the correct pattern and view query.

Tools used included `console.log()`, Django‚Äôs debug messages, and `heroku logs --tail`.

## üß† Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of Django and full-stack development. I learned how to:

- Build dynamic, user-friendly forms with formsets and Select2
- Use AJAX to enhance user experience in real-time without page reloads
- Implement responsive layouts using Bootstrap and dark mode customization
- Store media and sensitive data securely in production using environment variables
- Test, validate, and deploy a fully functional site on Heroku

If given more time, I would further expand features such as recipe commenting and a user-following system. This project helped me build confidence in deploying secure, scalable, and user-centered web applications.
