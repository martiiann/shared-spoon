---

## üéØ First-Time Visitor Goals

- Understand what the platform does upon landing.

---

## Returning Visitor Goals

- Log in and access saved (favorite) recipes.
- Add or manage personal recipes.

---

## üé® Design

- **Font**: 'Quicksand' via Google Fonts. This font was chosen for its clean, modern, and friendly appearance, which aligns with the approachable and user-focused experience of the recipe-sharing platform.
- **Color Theme**: Earthy tones with Bootstrap support. The color palette was selected to reflect a natural, homemade feel that matches the cooking theme while maintaining readability and contrast.
- **Color Palette Tool**: Palette was designed using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) to ensure accessible color contrast and visual harmony.
- **Dark Mode**: Uses `body.dark-mode` class to switch palette. This ensures a better experience for users in low-light environments and improves accessibility.
- **Buttons & Cards**: Styled with consistent Bootstrap 5 and custom shadows to maintain visual hierarchy and interactivity across different screen sizes.
- **CSS**: Clean, commented, and organized by sections (base, dark mode, recipe cards, forms) to support maintainability and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

The Shared Spoon project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using the following process:

### üîß Local Setup & Cloning

1. Cloning the Repository  
Open a terminal and run:  
`git clone https://github.com/martiiann/shared-spoon.git`  
`cd shared-spoon`

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
`python3 -m venv venv`  
`source venv/bin/activate` (Unix/Mac)  
`venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)

3. Install Required Dependencies  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Set Up Environment Variables  
Create an `env.py` file with the following:  
```python
import os  
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'  
os.environ['DATABASE_URL'] = 'your_postgres_url'  
os.environ['CLOUDINARY_URL'] = 'your_cloudinary_url'  
```

5. Database Setup  
`python manage.py makemigrations`  
`python manage.py migrate`

6. Create a Superuser  
`python manage.py createsuperuser`

7. Collect Static Files  
`python manage.py collectstatic`

---

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Heroku Deployment Steps

1. Create a New Heroku App  
Go to the Heroku dashboard ‚Üí "New" ‚Üí "Create new app" ‚Üí set your app name and region.

2. Connect GitHub Repository  
Under the Deploy tab, connect to GitHub and select the repository.

3. Set Config Vars  
In the Heroku dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Config Vars. Add the following:  
- `SECRET_KEY`  
- `DATABASE_URL`  
- `CLOUDINARY_URL`

4. Push to Heroku  
Run the following:  
`git push heroku main`

5. Disable Debug and Set Allowed Hosts  
In `settings.py`, make sure the following are set:  
```python
DEBUG = False  
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['shared-spoon-f2d629a69afc.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']  
```

6. Final Checks  
Ensure there is no commented-out code.  
Confirm flash messages work on login, logout, and CRUD actions.  
Test all user functionality, static/media files, and responsiveness on Heroku.

## üêû Debugging & Problem Solving

During development, I encountered and resolved several issues using Chrome DevTools, Django logs, and Heroku CLI. Key fixes included:

- **AJAX Ingredient Search**: Corrected a CSRF token issue and adjusted `data-url` in the dynamic form.
- **Static Files on Heroku**: Solved by setting up Whitenoise, ensuring `collectstatic` ran, and configuring `STATIC_ROOT`.
- **Formset Save Errors**: Fixed by using `commit=False` and linking child form data to the parent `Recipe` object.
- **404 on Recipe Detail**: Traced to a missing `pk` in the URL ‚Äî resolved with the correct pattern and view query.

Tools used included `console.log()`, Django‚Äôs debug messages, and `heroku logs --tail`.

---

## üß† Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of Django and full-stack development. I learned how to:

- Build dynamic, user-friendly forms with formsets and Select2
- Use AJAX to enhance user experience in real-time without page reloads
- Implement responsive layouts using Bootstrap and dark mode customization
- Store media and sensitive data securely in production using environment variables
- Test, validate, and deploy a fully functional site on Heroku

If given more time, I would further expand features such as recipe commenting and a user-following system. This project helped me build confidence in deploying secure, scalable, and user-centered web applications.
